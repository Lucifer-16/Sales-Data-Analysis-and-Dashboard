📊 Sales Data Analysis and Dashboard

📝 Problem Statement

Analyze a company’s historical sales data to identify key revenue drivers, detect seasonal trends, and suggest actionable improvements. The insights are visualized through interactive dashboards for better decision-making.

🎯 Objective

* Understand **sales patterns** and **customer behavior**.
* Identify **top-performing products, regions, and sales channels**.
* Highlight **seasonal trends** affecting revenue.
* Provide **data-driven recommendations** to improve business outcomes.
🚀 Features

* Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (handling missing values, duplicates, etc.)
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for sales insights
* Interactive Visualizations (using dashboards)
* Trend Analysis & Revenue Forecasting
* Actionable Recommendations for business growth

🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Programming Language**: Python
* **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
* **Dashboarding**: Power BI / Tableau / Plotly Dash (depending on implementation)
* **Data Source**: Historical Sales Dataset (CSV/Excel/Database)
